I recently switched from iPhone to Android. I love it but I miss the convince of using find my friends with my wife who is still on iPhone. Any apps that have similar functionality seem to either have a way to view location history which is to stalkerish for our needs or they have a time limit on how long sharing lasts. Are there any apps that provide real time location sharing without showing a location history? Thanks. 
Специальные программы. Программы – поисковики дают более точный результат. Но для этого нужно знать, какую программу выбрать, ведь таких программ очень много, есть платные Find My Friends from nLiteApps integrates location sharing with friends, as well as user device tracking, all within a single app!

We use Find my Friends to share our locations with each other, and I am wondering how we would be able to emulate this experience on Android. Thanks. A friend found an image, but was unable to find me a pattern -- it's a cute sloth, and above it says "U got an inhaler?" and below, says "cuz I heard you got DAT ASS MA". He says he saw it on reddit, but wasn't sure where. Etsy failed me. Did one of you amazing people create it? If so, are you willing to sell me a pattern? Sloths are my life and I really 
(Continuing)Any other games All my friends have Android so it forces me to use Google maps since this feature is included. I wish Apple would do something to see Android users.

I found a locked phone the other day and returning it was a PITA because I couldn't unlock it to retrieve the owner's information. A lot of people won't go to the trouble if you don't make it as easy as possible for them. Also, if you can help it, don't lose your phone. Bonus. Tried using Google Maps location sharing. Most of the time it shows us both being offline even though we have GMaps open, and it clearly knows where we are. Sometimes it does work okay, but only about a fifth of the time. Are we using it wrong? Hitting refresh rarely works, just says unable to refresh. I do apologize profusely for breaking the rules, and will accept a ban if it's deemed applicable by the mods. However, I need assistance. My best friend recently died because of what is believed to be suicide. His family believes there is reason to suspect that he reached out to his friends for help before he died for assistance and involuntary manslaughter may have occurred. I can submit proof to the mods if I have to, but only privately as I don't want personal info to be on the internet. I just switched from iPhone and Android. I can't find a good cross-platform "Find My Friends" equivalent. I just want to be able to see the location of my family members and for them to see my location.

(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.InvertedCircle.FindYoNuts) So I started this game a little over a year ago. Partnered up with a friend of mine (artist) who in the course of making the game passed away young and totally by surprise. I went through some depression, couldn't even open the project without breaking down. It was a tough go, but I managed in the end to wrap it up and get it online. I hope you enjoy it. Please. Hey guys Just bought my kid an S6, previously she was using an iPhone 5S. What app works just like Find my friends but cross platform (iOS and Android) since I still use the iPhone. Thanks in advance. Is there an android app that works with an iPhones find my friends. So, I'm moving to California this summer for my first year of college. I'm also switching from my iPhone 5 to a Galaxy S4 (no reason. I love my iPhone, but I miss Android and love tweaking the phone's software to my liking). Anyways, so my family is very close, and we use Apple's Find My Friend's app to keep in touch (and to make sure none of us have been kidnapped. seriously, this is why my mom made my whole family get it lmao. and no she doesn't use it 24/7 to track me like an animal.
