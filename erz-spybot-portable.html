I propose that we use Spybot Anti-Beacon (https://www.safer-networking.org/spybot-anti-beacon/) The only mention of it I could find was here (https://www.reddit.com/r/TronScript/comments/4074dy/ui_privacy_tweaks_3rd_party_apps_and_other_inquiry/).

I recently had to do a clean install on a laptop, and I used it as an opportunity to really assess which programs where necessary for my everyday use. The following is a list of every program I installed. I tried to give a description of what they do, and why I chose them.

So I finally decided to come back to tech support after working 5 years in a different industry. I finally splurged on a new fancy usb 3.0 256 gb flash drive, and I realized I've been out of the tech support loop and I'm trying to decide how to use it. I'm thinking of Partitioning ( it with 2-3 partitions. One with Yumi to boot several Operating Systems (The ISO List). One for professional help tools (Tech support), and one for Personal files.

The house had internet, since her PS3 was streaming Netflix, but she kept getting a Proxy Server error on Chrome.

I cant access the task manager anymore and I'm pretty sure I'm being keylogged. I immediately reseted my computer scanned with avg and nothing came up.

I do computer maintenance as a hobby/starting business and I'd like to know if it's possible to run "portable" (i.e. no need to install on client machine, usually stored on flash drive) apps like spybot and defragging programs through remote desktop of some sort from my local machine? Pretty much, wanna run an app (located on my computer) on someone else's via remote desktop. I'm hoping somebody here knows how to get rid of this damn thing. A friend of mine (who decided to uninstall Avast) called me up today to take a look at his computer because it was running slow and he was getting some weird notepad popup.

I'd never seen it in the wild, but there it was, a ransom note that said it encrypted his files with CryptoWall and instructed him to go online and pay the fee for his files to be decrypted. 
First off, I'm a total n00b so I greatly appreciate any help or advice that I receive. On topic, can things like combofix, mbam, rkill, spybot, etc. be saved onto a jumpdrive?

Is it safe to install malware removal software (tdss,spybot,Combofix,hijackthis etc.) on a USB flash drive and use it to fix a couple infected computers?
